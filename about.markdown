Hello There!

Thank you for being here, my name is Khaled Al-Ansari and I work as a software engineer (yeah another one of those people online!).

I created this website as a personal ID to share some of the stuff I'm interested in and to introduce myself to those who need to. Currently the website is still simple and does not have much but I will enhance it the future inshallah.

For now you can view [my resume](http://khaledelansari.com/online-cv/) or just read some of [my blogs](https://khaledelansari.blogspot.com/), please don't hesitate to reach out for anything and remember its for free so nothing to lose!

That's it for now, till next time... salam.
