                	<p>
                		“Modern web pages are becoming increasingly full-featured, and this additional functionality often requires greater use of asynchrony. Unfortunately, this asynchrony can trigger unexpected concurrency errors, even though web page scripts are executed sequentially.” And that's why detecting Races becomes important to help the developers build better and smooth website and to focus on other stuff while building the website.

                	<p>
                		Browser were built to load web pages sequentially (from the meta data in the headers to the last JavaScript script in the bottom of the body tag) so is the JavaScript code and that was ok for the simple websites till the moment website started to get more complicated with dozens of events and data from different sources.
            		</p>
                	<p>
						Different problems faced the web users and one of the popular problems was the Hotmail email service<span class="look-at-footnote">(1)</span> where the message content was lost due to race condition while using the Mozilla FireFox browser.

                	<p>
                		The need to discover races to deliver a better web experience to the users caused the authors to start the WebRacer project. The main two methods they develop are “happens-before relation” for the JavaScript & HTML relation (via the DOM) and “logical memory locations” which normally represent reads and writes for the data.
                	</p>
                	<p>
                		Of course there were some restrictions like the prototype chain in JavaScript and the eval function (which unfortunately used a lot by developers in production websites).

							### Race Types

							* Variable Races
							* HTML Races
							* Function Races
							* Event Dispatch Races
						</script>
				  	</section>
				  	<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							### Variable Races

							This a real example, the race was discovered at **southwest.com**. The user might submit the default value of the `input` tag before the script below is loaded.

							```html
							<input type="text" id="depart" />
							<button type="submit"></button>
							...
							<script type="text/javascript">
								// add a hint to the box
								document.getElementById("depart").value =
								"City of Departure";
								// code to remove hint when user clicks
							<script/>
							...
							```
						</script>
				  	</section>
				  	<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							### HTML Races

							This race was discovered on **valero.com** by the tool. When the user click to send an email the script will get the hidden element and apply some style on it, the element might not be loaded at the time when user clicks the send button.

							```html
								<script type="text/javascript">
									function show(emailTo,EmailC) {
										EmailC.value = emailTo;
										v = $get(’dw’);
										v.style.display = "block";
									}
								<script/>
								...
								<a href="javascript:show(’x@x.com’,a)">
									<!-- Send Email -->
								</a>
								...
								<div id=dw style="display:none">
									<!-- HTML form to send email -->
								</div>
							```
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							### Function Races

							The function `doNextStep()` could be invoked before declaring script is loaded even with the delay from `setTimeout()`

							```html
							<iframe id="i" src="bug413310-subframe.html"
							onload="setTimeout(doNextStep, 20)">
							</iframe>
							...
							<script type="text/javascript">
							...
							function doNextStep() {...}
							<script/>
							```
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							### Event Dispatch Races

							The `onload` method might never run in case the `iframe` load was faster than the script!

							```html
							<iframe id="i" src="a.html" />
							...
							<script>
								document.getElementById("i").onload = function() {...}
							<script/>
							```
						</script>

							### Happens-Before

							happens-before relation captures key ordering constraints for the most common web-platform features and there's a lot of constructs in web page HTML tags, Scripts (async & defer), DOMs, Frames (iframe), Events and Handlers, Window & DOM loa and Time Execution functions.

							After knowing the constructs now we need to know the operations that will help defining the Happens-Before relation and there: *exe(E)*, *cb(E)*, *cbi(E)*, *create(E)* (If E is a static HTML element, then *create(E) = parse(E)*), *dispi(E, T)*, *ld(T)* (denotes *disp0 (load, T)*, if T has a load event) and *dcl(D)* (denotes *disp0 (DOMContentLoaded, D)* for a document D). And there's 2 Atomic operations parsing of HTML & execution of script code.

                		<script type="text/template">
							### Happens-Before

							Now we can start building the Happens-Before relation, denoted with the symbol **≺** which can be describe: **≺ ⊆ OpId × OpId**, so if **A ≺ B** it mean **(A, B) ∈ ≺**, and if B is a set of operations then **∀(a, b) ∈ {A} × B**. These relationships will help detecting which operation is before the other, you can see a full explanation for the operations in section 3.2 & section 3.4

                	<p>
                		Memory Locations is a huge challange in the web apps, unlike the low-level languages like C JavaScript don't control the memory location (heap) browsers just allocate a place for data after variable declaration and delete it with delete keyword. The authors focused on following a unified pratice in all of the scripts to guarantee a reasonable results, some of the practices are:
                	</p>
                	<ul>
                		<li>Using closure for Function decleration and after it allow any other variable declaration</li>
                		<li>Using selectors connect to the document object when they want to access HTML elements via DOM same thing for event handlers</li>
                	</ul>

							### Race Detection

							Here we define the race detection according to the happens-before and memory access we discuss previously, first we difine a Race: let assume we have ops A and A', so **A, A' ∈ {read, write} × OpId** will race at:

							* **op(A) = op(A)** (accesses performed by different operations).
							* **op(A) ≺ op(A)** and **op(A) ≺ op(A)** (the operations are not in the happens-before).
							* **kind(A) = write** or **kind(A) = write** (one of the accesses is a write).
							* **op** gives the operation identifier for an access, and **kind** gives the access type (read or write).

							<h3>Race Detection</h3>

							<p>
							Now we define the Algorithm, to do so we first maintain the LastRead and LastWrite for the Location (Loc): LastRead, LastWrite ∈ Loc → ld. Where Loc = HElem ∪ JSV ar ∪ Eloc and Id = {⊥} ∪ OpId. ⊥ here is designated as a value for initialization. Now we define Can-Happen-Concurrently (CHC) as:
							</p>
							<p class="text-center"><b>CHC ∈ OpId × OpId → Bool</b></p>
							<p class="text-center"><b>CHC(A, B) = A ≠ ⊥ ∧ B ≠ ⊥ ∧ A ⊀ B ∧ B ⊀ A</b></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Race Detection</h3>
						<p>
							“Intuitively, two operations A and B can happen concurrently when both are not equal to <b>⊥</b> and (A, B) and (B, A) are not in the happens-before relation.“ (some race examples can be found at the end of section 5.1)
							The Algorithm has some limitations the following case is one of them
							<p class="text-center"><b>1 : read e || 2 : write e || 3 : read e</b></p>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Race Detection</h3>
						<p>
							Finally to make the Race Detector effective on production sites they applied some filters and they are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Focus on form races: they focused on data coming from form (example: sign-up forms) since they have the highest possibility of race because users always interact with them</li>
							<li>Focus on single-dispatch events: focusing on events that mostly happens one time to give a better race detection results for a better detecting in the future based on the reads they get from them.</li>

						<h3>Limitations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The authors didn't add an instrumentation for the AJAX calls.</li>
							<li>They didn't handle clearTimeout and clearInterval calls, those calls might have a race with setTimeout and setInterval calls.</li>
							<li>Race Detector is not 100% accurate for example if you moved an element with <b>appendChild</b> and then called with <b>getElementById</b> the algorithm will call for a race.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Limitations</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>The Race Detector can't handle hidden elements events causing false-positive races.</li>
							<li>Race Detector is not optimized and have a heavy performance issue (one of the reasons is disabling the JIT).</li>
							<li>Authors are not familier with the WebKit engine so they didn't manipulate the engine very well.</li>
